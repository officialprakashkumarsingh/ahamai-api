## Next Steps

⚠️ **Important:** The Cloudflare Worker needs to be deployed for these changes to take effect on the live API endpoint.

The API endpoint `https://ahamai-api.officialprakashkrsingh.workers.dev/v1/models` will continue showing the old model list until the worker is redeployed with the updated workers.js file.

## Quality Improvement

With the removal of problematic models:
- Eliminated models with garbled responses
- Eliminated models with empty responses  
- Kept only high-quality, reliable models
- Reduced API surface area for better maintainability

**Result:** 17 high-quality models remaining, with better overall API reliability.
