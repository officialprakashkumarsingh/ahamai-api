# Screenshot and Stock Data Features

## Overview

The API now includes two powerful new capabilities that work with ALL chat models:

1. **Website Screenshot Capture** - Take screenshots of any website on demand
2. **Real-Time Stock Data** - Fetch live market data for any stock ticker

Both features work automatically - the AI detects when they're needed and provides the information seamlessly.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Capability

### How It Works
- Uses WordPress mshots API (free, no authentication required)
- Automatically detects when users want to see a website
- Provides direct screenshot URLs that can be viewed in browser

### Automatic Detection
The system detects screenshot requests when users say:
- "Show me [website]"
- "Take a screenshot of [URL]"
- "What does [website] look like?"
- "Preview [URL]"
- "Capture [website]"

### Example Requests

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Show me what google.com looks like"
    }
  ]
}
```

**AI Response:**
```
I'll capture a screenshot of google.com for you.

Here's the current view of the website:
https://s.wordpress.com/mshots/v1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com?w=1280&h=960

This screenshot shows the Google homepage with its iconic search bar...
```

### Screenshot URL Format
```

```

## ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Data

### How It Works
- Uses Yahoo Finance API (free, no authentication required)

### Automatic Detection
The system detects stock requests when users mention:

    }
  ]
}
```
