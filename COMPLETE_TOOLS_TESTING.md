# External Tools - Complete Testing Scenarios

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing scenarios for the fully enhanced external tools system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. üîß Function Calling System
- Built-in tools: `web_scrape`, `take_screenshot`
- Proper tool definitions and execution
- Enhanced system prompts for clear function calling instructions

### 2. üìä Response Metadata & Visibility  
- `tool_execution_summary` in all responses when tools are used
- Debug mode with `debug_tools: true` shows detailed execution info
- Addresses "raw json don't show in response" complaint

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Automatic Fallback System
- Detects when AI mentions tools but doesn't use function calling
- Automatically executes tools based on content analysis
- Ensures tools work even with models that don't support function calling well

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Smart Warnings & Detection
- Warns when models should use tools but don't
- Provides troubleshooting suggestions
- Helps identify function calling capability issues

## Complete Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ideal Function Calling (AI Uses Tools Correctly)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Please scrape content from https://example.com and take a screenshot"
      }
    ],
    "debug_tools": true
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "I've scraped the content and taken a screenshot of example.com...",
        "tool_calls_executed": [
          {"function_name": "web_scrape", "arguments": "{\"url\":\"https://example.com\"}"},
          {"function_name": "take_screenshot", "arguments": "{\"url\":\"https://example.com\"}"}
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_execution_summary": {
    "tools_used": 2,
    "tool_names": ["web_scrape", "take_screenshot"],
    "execution_successful": true
  }
}
```

### Scenario 2: AI Doesn't Use Function Calling (Automatic Fallback)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "some-model-without-good-function-calling",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Can you scrape the content from https://github.com?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "I can help you scrape content from GitHub...\n\n*Note: I've automatically executed the requested tools to provide you with current data.*\n\n[Enhanced response with actual scraped content]"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_execution_summary": {
    "tools_used": 1,
    "tool_names": ["web_scrape"],
    "execution_successful": true,
    "execution_type": "automatic_fallback"
  },
  "automatic_execution_notice": "Tools were automatically executed because the AI model did not use function calling"
}
```

### Scenario 3: Model Mentions Tools But No URLs (Warning Only)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I want to scrape some website content but I don't have a URL yet"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "I can help you scrape website content once you provide a URL..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "function_calling_warning": {
    "message": "AI model may not be using function calling properly",
    "suggestions": ["Check if model supports function calling", "Verify tool definitions", "Test with different model"],
    "urls_detected": []
  }
}
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple URLs with Mixed Tools
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Compare github.com and gitlab.com - get content from both and show me screenshots"
      }
    ],
    "debug_tools": true
  }'
```

**Expected:** 4 tool calls (2 scrapes + 2 screenshots) or automatic fallback if function calling fails.

## Console Log Patterns

### ‚úÖ Successful Function Calling
```
üîß ADDED BUILT-IN TOOLS: [ 'web_scrape', 'take_screenshot' ]
üîß TOOLS CONFIGURED IN PAYLOAD:
=== PROCESSING MODEL RESPONSE FOR TOOL CALLS ===
‚úÖ Found 2 structured tool calls: [ 'web_scrape', 'take_screenshot' ]
üîß EXECUTING 2 TOOL CALLS...
‚úÖ Tool web_scrape executed successfully
‚úÖ Tool take_screenshot executed successfully
‚úÖ Follow-up request successful
‚úÖ Added tool execution metadata to response
```

### üîÑ Automatic Fallback System
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: AI mentioned web content/screenshots but did not make function calls!
üîÑ ATTEMPTING FALLBACK TOOL EXECUTION...
URLs found: [ 'https://example.com' ]
üîß EXECUTING 2 AUTOMATIC TOOL CALLS...
‚úÖ Automatic tool web_scrape executed successfully
‚úÖ Automatic tool take_screenshot executed successfully
‚úÖ Automatic tool execution successful, returning enhanced response
```

### ‚ùå No Function Calling Support
```
‚ùå No tool calls found, returning original response
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: AI mentioned web content/screenshots but did not make function calls!
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Guaranteed Tool Execution**: Tools will work either through proper function calling OR automatic fallback
2. **Complete Visibility**: Users can see exactly what tools were used and how
3. **Smart Detection**: System identifies and handles function calling issues automatically
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging and debug mode for troubleshooting
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Works with models that don't support function calling

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ "Raw JSON shows in response" - via tool_execution_summary
- ‚úÖ "External tool calling performing" - via function calling + automatic fallback
- ‚úÖ Enhanced user experience with tool usage visibility
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive debugging and monitoring capabilities

This system ensures that external tools work reliably regardless of the AI model's function calling capabilities while providing complete transparency about tool usage.
