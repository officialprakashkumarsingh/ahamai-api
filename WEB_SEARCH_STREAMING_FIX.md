# Web Search Streaming Reliability Fixes

## Problem Summary
The web search feature was failing or stopping mid-stream due to several issues:
1. No timeout on Google Search API calls
2. Missing error handling in streaming functions
3. No proper cleanup when requests fail
4. No fallback mechanisms

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Timeout to Google Search API**
```javascript
// Before: Could hang indefinitely
const searchResponse = await fetch(googleSearchUrl);

// After: 10-second timeout with AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000);
const searchResponse = await fetch(googleSearchUrl, {
  signal: controller.signal
});
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents indefinite hanging
- Graceful timeout after 10 seconds
- Continues with available information if search times out

### 2. **Enhanced Streaming Error Handling**
Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error recovery:

```javascript
async start(controller) {
  try {
    // Main streaming logic
    
    // Nested try-catch for model request
    try {
      response = await makeModelRequest(...);
    } catch (modelError) {
      // Send error message to stream
      // Close stream gracefully
    }
    
    // Error handling for stream reading
    try {
      while (true) {
        const { done, value } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;
        controller.enqueue(value);
      }
    } catch (readError) {
      // Send stream interruption message
    } finally {
      // Always attempt to close controller
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Top-level error handling
    // Send error to stream if possible
    // Ensure stream is closed
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches errors at multiple levels
- Sends error messages to the stream instead of silently failing
- Always attempts to close the stream properly
- Prevents hanging connections

### 3. **Improved Error Messages**
Now provides clear feedback when issues occur:
- `[Error: Model request failed. Retrying without web search...]`
- `[Stream interrupted. Please try again.]`
- `Web search timed out. Proceeding with available information.`

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**
Instead of failing completely:
- If search times out → Continue with available information
- If search fails → Proceed without search results
- If model fails → Send error message and close stream properly

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Search API Timeout
**Test:** Slow or unresponsive search API
**Result:** Times out after 10 seconds, continues with query

### Scenario 2: Model Request Failure
**Test:** Model endpoint returns error
**Result:** Error message sent to stream, stream closed gracefully

### Scenario 3: Stream Reading Error
**Test:** Connection interrupted during streaming
**Result:** Error message sent if possible, stream closed properly

### Scenario 4: Search API Error
**Test:** Search API returns error or malformed response
**Result:** Proceeds without search results rather than failing

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal overhead:** Error handling adds negligible latency
- **Better reliability:** Prevents hanging requests
- **Improved UX:** Users get feedback instead of silent failures

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Log Analysis**
   - Monitor `[Web Search]` prefixed logs
   - Track timeout occurrences
   - Count model request failures

2. **Metrics to Track**
   - Search API response times
   - Timeout frequency
   - Stream completion rates
   - Error recovery success rates

3. **Alerts**
   - Set up alerts for high timeout rates
   - Monitor for repeated model failures
   - Track stream interruption patterns

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Timeouts**
   - Adjust timeout based on historical response times
   - Shorter timeouts for known fast queries

2. **Model Fallback Chain**
   - Automatically try alternative models on failure
   - Implement smart model selection based on availability

3. **Partial Results**
   - Stream partial search results as they arrive
   - Don't wait for all 20 results if some are slow

4. **Connection Pooling**
   - Reuse connections to search API
   - Reduce connection overhead

5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Temporarily disable web search if failure rate is high
   - Automatic recovery when service is healthy

## Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Added proper error boundaries
- ✅ Implemented timeout mechanisms
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging
- ✅ Graceful error recovery
- ✅ Clear error messaging to users

## Summary
These fixes significantly improve the reliability of web search during streaming by:
- Preventing indefinite hangs
- Providing clear error feedback
- Ensuring streams are properly closed
- Continuing service even when components fail

The system is now more resilient and provides a better user experience even when encountering errors.
