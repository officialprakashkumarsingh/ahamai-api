# Enhanced External Tools Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions for the enhanced external tools functionality with improved debugging and visibility.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Debugging System
- Added emoji-based logging for easy identification
- Comprehensive response structure logging  
- Tool execution tracing with detailed status updates
- Function call detection and execution monitoring

### 2. Response Metadata
- Added `tool_execution_summary` to responses when tools are used
- Includes tools used count and tool names
- Debug mode shows detailed tool call information

### 3. Function Call Detection
- Warns when AI mentions web content but doesn't make function calls
- Helps identify when models aren't using function calling properly

### 4. Debug Mode
- Add `"debug_tools": true` to request to see detailed tool execution info
- Shows tool calls executed in response metadata

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Web Scraping
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b", 
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Please scrape the content from https://example.com and tell me what you find"
      }
    ],
    "debug_tools": true
  }'
```

**Expected Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "Based on scraping example.com, I found...",
        "tool_calls_executed": [
          {
            "id": "tool_xxx",
            "function_name": "web_scrape", 
            "arguments": "{\"url\":\"https://example.com\"}"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_execution_summary": {
    "tools_used": 1,
    "tool_names": ["web_scrape"],
    "execution_successful": true
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Screenshot Tool
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Show me what google.com looks like by taking a screenshot"
      }
    ],
    "debug_tools": true
  }'
```

### Test 3: Multiple Tools
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Analyze github.com - scrape its content and take a screenshot"
      }
    ],
    "debug_tools": true
  }'
```

### Test 4: Model Not Using Function Calls
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Can you get the content from example.com?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**If model doesn't use function calls, response will include:**
```json
{
  "function_calling_warning": {
    "message": "AI model may not be using function calling properly",
    "suggestions": ["Check if model supports function calling", "Verify tool definitions", "Test with different model"]
  }
}
```

## Console Logs to Monitor

### Successful Function Calling Flow
```
üîß ADDED BUILT-IN TOOLS: [ 'web_scrape', 'take_screenshot' ]
üîß TOOLS CONFIGURED IN PAYLOAD:
- Tool count: 2
- Tool choice: auto
- Tool names: [web_scrape, take_screenshot]
=== PROCESSING MODEL RESPONSE FOR TOOL CALLS ===
‚úÖ Found 1 structured tool calls: [ 'web_scrape' ]
üîß EXECUTING 1 TOOL CALLS...
üîß Executing tool: web_scrape with ID: tool_xxx
üåê Scraping website: https://example.com
‚úÖ Web scrape tool response prepared - Content length: 1234
üîÑ Making follow-up request with 1 tool results...
‚úÖ Follow-up request successful
‚úÖ Added tool execution metadata to response
```

### Warning Signs
```
‚ùå No tool calls found, returning original response
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: AI mentioned web content/screenshots but did not make function calls!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No function calls being made
**Symptoms:** Console shows "‚ùå No tool calls found" 
**Solutions:**
1. Check if model supports function calling
2. Verify tools are being configured properly 
3. Try more explicit language: "Call the web_scrape function"
4. Test with different model

### Issue: Tools configured but not used
**Symptoms:** Logs show tools configured but no function calls detected
**Solutions:**
1. Model may not support function calling - check with different model
2. Try the auto model: `"model": "auto"`
3. Check if system prompt is being overridden

### Issue: Function calls made but no results
**Symptoms:** Logs show tool execution but empty response
**Solutions:**
1. Check network connectivity for scraping
2. Verify URL is accessible 
3. Check for rate limiting

## Debug Mode Benefits

Enable with `"debug_tools": true`:
- See exactly which tools were called
- View tool call IDs and arguments
- Get execution summary in response
- Easier troubleshooting

## Next Steps

Once function calling is verified to work:
1. Re-enable external tools for automatic context
2. Optimize tool selection logic
3. Add more tool types
4. Implement streaming support for tool calls
